# Creating a Chain; Core Contracts

In a test we can deploy one or several chains, deploy smart contracts on them,
and invoke them.

In the example `TestTutorial1`, the statement
`chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex1")` creates and deploys a new chain `ex1` in the
environment of the test. Several chains may be deployed in the test.

Deploying a chain automatically means deployment of all core smart contracts on
it. The core contracts are responsible for the vital functions of the chain and
provide infrastructure for all other smart contracts:

- [root](../contract_core/root.md). Responsible for the initialization of the chain, maintains
  the global parameters, and the registry of deployed contracts. It also handles
  fees and performs other functions.

- [_default](../contract_core/default.md). Any request that cannot be handled by any of the
  other deployed contracts ends up here.

- [accounts](../contract_core/accounts.md). Responsible for the on-chain ledger of accounts. The
  on-chain accounts contain colored tokens, which are controlled by smart
  contracts and addresses on the UTXO Ledger.

- [blob](../contract_core/blob.md). Responsible for the immutable registry of binary objects of
  arbitrary size. One blob is a collection of named binary chunks of data. For
  example, a blob can be used to store a collections of _wasm_ binaries, needed
  to deploy _WebAssembly_ smart contracts. Each blob in the registry is 
  referenced by its hash which is deterministically calculated from its data.

- [blocklog](../contract_core/blocklog.md). Keeps track of the blocks, requests and event that were
  processed by the chain.


## Writing and compiling first Rust smart contract

In this section we will create a new smart contract. We will write its code in
Rust, and then will use the `wasplib` [library](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/master/contracts/rust/wasmlib)
and `wasm-pack` to compile it into a WebAssembly (_wasm_) binary.

Note that this tutorial is not a tutorial of the ISCP smart contract development
environment: for that we will provide other tutorials. The only goal of these
examples is an introduction to fundamental principles of ISCP smart contracts.

We assume you already have Rust and `wasm-pack`
[installed](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/).

We will be using the examples from the `wasp` repository located in
[https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/develop/docOps/tutorial/rust-example](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/develop/docOps/tutorial/rust-example) directory.

The `rust-example` smart contract is a simple smart contract which stores a
string in its state upon request and allows to retrieve the stored string by
calling a view. The smart contract also implements an entry point which allows
the creator of the smart contract instance to withdraw all iotas contained in
the smart contract's account on the chain.

```rust
use wasmlib::*;

const PARAM_STRING: &str = "paramString";
const VAR_STRING: &str = "storedString";

#[no_mangle]
fn on_load() {
    // declare entry points of the smart contract
    let exports = ScExports::new();
    exports.add_func("storeString", store_string);
    exports.add_view("getString", get_string);
    exports.add_func("withdrawIota", withdraw_iota);
}

// storeString entry point stores a string provided as parameters
// in the state as a value of the key 'storedString'
// panics if parameter is not provided
fn store_string(ctx: &ScFuncContext) {
    // take parameter paramString
    let par = ctx.params().get_string(PARAM_STRING);
    // require parameter exists
    ctx.require(par.exists(), "string parameter not found");

    // store the string in "storedString" variable
    ctx.state().get_string(VAR_STRING).set_value(&par.value());
    // log the text
    let msg = "Message stored: ".to_string() + &par.value();
    ctx.log(&msg);
}

// getString view returns the string value of the key 'storedString'
// The call return result as a key/value dictionary.
// the returned value in the result is under key 'paramString'
fn get_string(ctx: &ScViewContext) {
    // take the stored string
    let s = ctx.state().get_string(VAR_STRING).value();
    // return the string value in the result dictionary
    ctx.results().get_string(PARAM_STRING).set_value(&s);
}

// withdraw_iota sends all iotas contained in the contract's account
// to the caller's L1 address.
// Panics of the caller is not an address
// Panics if the address is not the creator of the contract is the caller
// The caller will be address only if request is sent from the wallet on the L1, not a smart contract
fn withdraw_iota(ctx: &ScFuncContext) {
    let creator = ctx.contract_creator();
    let caller = ctx.caller();

    ctx.require(creator == caller, "not authorised");
    ctx.require(caller.is_address(), "caller must be an address");

    let bal = ctx.balances().balance(&ScColor::IOTA);
    if bal > 0 {
        ctx.transfer_to_address(&caller.address(), ScTransfers::new(&ScColor::IOTA, bal))
    }
}
```

Running the `wasm-pack build` command will produce something like this:

```
C:/Users/evaldas/.cargo/bin/wasm-pack.exe build -- --color=always
[INFO]: Checking for the Wasm target...
[INFO]: Compiling to Wasm...
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.05s

[INFO]: :-) Your wasm pkg is ready to publish at C:\Users\evaldas\Documents\proj\Go\src\github.com\iotaledger\wasp\docOps\tutorial-examples\pkg.
```

The 17KB file `example_tutorial_bg.wasm` is the binary of the smart contract. We
will be using it in further examples. The file contains everything needed to
deploy the smart contract on a chain run on the ISCP network.
