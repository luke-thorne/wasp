# Accounts: deposit and withdraw tokens

Multiple chains in ISCP adds another dimension to the ledger: smart contracts
can exchange assets between themselves on different chains as well as with
addresses on the UTXO Ledger. We will skip explaining the whole picture for time
being and will concentrate on one specific use case.

Let's say we have a wallet, we have private key (the address) and some tokens on
the address. The use case is about sending tokens to and receiving tokens from a
smart contract on a chain.

Here we explore the concept of `on-chain account` or just `account`. On the UTXO
Ledger the private key is represented by the address (the hash of the public
key). That address holds balances of colored tokens. Those tokens are
"controlled" by the private key.

In ISCP we extend the concept of _address_ with the concept of `account`. An 
`account` contains colored tokens just like an `address`. The `account` is
located on some chain, and it is controlled by the same private key as the 
associated address. So, an address can control tokens on the UTXO Ledger 
(Level-1, or `L1`) and on each chain (Level-2, or `L2`).

The chain essentially is a custodian of the tokens deposited in its `accounts`.

The following test demonstrates how a wallet can deposit tokens in a chain 
account and then withdraw them back.

```go
func TestTutorial5(t *testing.T) {
    env := solo.New(t, false, false)
    chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex5")

    // create a wallet with solo.Saldo iotas.
    // the wallet has address and it is globally identified
    // through a universal identifier: the agent ID
    userWallet, userAddress := env.NewKeyPairWithFunds()
    userAgentID := iscp.NewAgentID(userAddress, 0)
    
    env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, solo.Saldo) // solo.Saldo on address
    chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, 0)  // empty on-chain
    
    t.Logf("Address of the userWallet is: %s", userAddress)
    numIotas := env.GetAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA)
    t.Logf("balance of the userWallet is: %d iota", numIotas)
    env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, solo.Saldo)
    
    // send 42 iotas from wallet to own account on-chain, controlled by the same wallet
    req := solo.NewCallParams(accounts.Name, accounts.FuncDeposit)
    req.WithIotas(42)
    _, err := chain.PostRequestSync(req, userWallet)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // check address balance: must be 42 iotas less
    env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, solo.Saldo-42)
    // check the on-chain account. Must contain 42 iotas
    chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, 42)
    
    // withdraw all iotas
    req = solo.NewCallParams(accounts.Name, accounts.FuncWithdraw)
    req.WithIotas(1)
    _, err = chain.PostRequestSync(req, userWallet)
    require.NoError(t, err)
    
    // we are back to initial situation: IOTA is fee-less!
    env.AssertAddressBalance(userAddress, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, solo.Saldo-1)
    chain.AssertAccountBalance(userAgentID, ledgerstate.ColorIOTA, 0) // empty
}
```

The example above creates a chain, then creates a wallet with solo.Saldo iotas and
sends (deposits) 42 iotas to the corresponding on-chain account by posting
a `deposit` request to the `accounts` core contract on that chain. That account
will now contain 42 iotas. The address on the UTXO Ledger will contain 42 iotas
less, of course.

In the next step the same wallet (`userWallet`) will withdraw all 42 iotas back
to the address by sending a `withdraw` request to the `accounts` contract on 
the same chain.

If the same request would be posted from another user wallet (another private
key), the `withdraw` request would fail. Try it! Only the owner of the address
can move those funds from the on-chain account.
