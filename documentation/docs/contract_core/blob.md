# The `blob` contract

The `blob` contract is one of the [core contracts](overview.md) on each ISCP
chain.

The function of the `blob` contract is to maintain an on-chain registry of
_blobs_, which consist of arbitrary binary data. The _blobs_ are referenced from
smart contracts via their hashes.

A _blob_ is a collection of named pieces of arbitrary binary data:

```
    <fieldName1> : <binaryChunk1>
    <fieldName2> : <binaryChunk2>
    ...
    <fieldNameN> : <binaryChunkN>
``` 

Here the `fieldNameK` is an arbitrary binary string used as a name for the
binary data `binaryChunkK`. Usually `fieldNameK` is not long. Its interpretation
is use-case specific.

The `binaryChunkK` may be of arbitrary size (practical limits apply, of course).

The order of the field-chunk pairs is essential.

The hash of the _blob_ is equal to the hash of concatenation of all pieces:

```
    blobHash = hash( fieldName1 || binaryChunk1 || fieldName2 || binaryChunk2 || ... || fieldNameN || binaryChunkN)
``` 

There are two predefined field names which are interpreted by the VM while
deploying smart contracts from binary:

- _fieldname_ = `"v"` is interpreted as a _VM type_
- _fieldname_ = `"p"` is interpreted as a _smart contract program binary_

If the field `"v"` is equal to the string `"wasmtimevm"`, the binary chunk
of `"p""` is interpreted as WebAssembly binary, loadable into the _Wasmtime_
Wasm VM.

Another use_case for a _blob_ may be a full collection of self-described
immutable data of a smart contract program:

```
    "v" : VM type
    "p" : smart contract program binary
    "d" : data schema for data exchange between smart contract and outside sources and consumers
    "s" : program sources in .zip format
```

### Entry points

There's only one entry point, which allows us to submit a _blob_ to the `blob`
contract:

* **storeBlob** - In the current implementation the data of the _blob_ is passed
  as parameters to the call of the entry point. It may be practically impossible
  to submit very large _blobs_ to the chain. In the future we plan to implement
  a special mechanism which allows for the nodes to download big data chunks as
  part of the committee consensus.

### Views

* **getBlobInfo** - Returns information about fields of the blob with specific
  hash and sizes of its data chunks:

```
    <fieldName1>: <size of the dataChunk1>
    ...
    <fieldNameN>: <size of the dataChunkN>
```

* **getBlobField** - Returns the data of the specified _blob_ field.

* **listBlobs** - Returns a list of pairs `blob hash`: `total size of chunks`
  for all blobs in the registry.
