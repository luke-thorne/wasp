# Validators

Each chain is run by that chain's *committee of validators*. This committee owns a key that is split between all of its validators. Each key share is useless on its own, but a collective signature gives validators full control over the chain.

ISC does not define how do you select validators to form a committee: it could be a solitary choice of the chain's owner, or it could be a [public competition](https://wiki.assembly.sc/learn/introduction/) between candidates. ISC does not define how validators are rewarded, either.
