# The `blocklog` Contract

The `blocklog` contract is one of the [core contracts](overview.md) on each IOTA Smart Contracts chain.

The function of the `blocklog` contract is to keep track of the blocks of
requests that were processed by the chain.

It provides views to get request status or receipts, block information, or events (per request / block / smart contract).

## Entry Points

The `blocklog` core contract does not contain any entry points which modify its
state.

The only way to modify the `blocklog` state is by submitting requests for
processing to the chain.
