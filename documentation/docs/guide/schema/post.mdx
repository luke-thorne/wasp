# Posting Asynchronous Requests

Asynchronous function calls between smart contracts are posted as requests on the Tangle.
They allow you to invoke any smart contract function that is not a View on any smart
contract chain. You will notice that the behavior is very similar to a normal function
call, but instead of using the `call()` method of the `func` member in the function
descriptor, you will now use the `post()` or `postToChain()` methods. `post()` posts the
request within the current chain, while `postToChain()` takes the chain ID of the
desired chain as parameter.

In addition to the previously discussed [transferBaseTokens()](call.mdx) and
[ofContract()](call.mdx) methods, you can modify the behavior further by providing a
delay() in seconds, which enables delayed execution of the request. This is of particular
interest to smart contracts that need a delayed action like betting contracts with a timed
betting round, or to create time-lock functionality in a smart contract.
Here's how that works:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      groupId="language"
      values={[
          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
          {label: 'Rust', value: 'rust'},
          {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
      ]}>

<TabItem value="go">

```go
eor := ScFuncs.EndOfRound(ctx)
eor.Func.Delay(3600).TransferBaseTokens(1).Post()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="rust">

```rust
let eor = ScFuncs::end_of_round(ctx);
eor.func.delay(3600).transfer_base_tokens(1).post();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ts">

```ts
let eor = sc.ScFuncs.endOfRound(ctx);
eor.func.delay(3600).transferBaseTokens(1).post();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Because it is posted as a request on the Tangle, and it is not possible to have a request
without a transfer, _an asynchronous request always needs to send at least 1 token_. So,
if you post to a function that expects tokens you just specify the amount of tokens
required, but if you post to a function that does not expect any tokens then you still
have to provide 1 iota.

**Providing a delay() before a call() will result in a run-time error**. We do not know
the intention of the user until the actual call() or post() is encountered, so we cannot
check for this at compile-time unless we are willing to accept a lot of extra overhead.
It should not really be a problem because using delay() is rare and using it with call()
cannot have been the intention.

The function that posts the request through the function descriptor will immediately
continue execution and does not wait for its completion. Therefore, it is not possible to
directly retrieve the return values from such a call.

If you need some return values, you will have to create a mechanism that can do so, for
example by providing a callback chain/contract/function combination as part of the input
parameters of the requested function, so that upon completion that function can
asynchronously post the results to the indicated function. It will require a certain
degree of cooperation between both smart contracts. In the future we will probably be
looking at providing a generic mechanism for this.

In the next section we will look at how we can use the function descriptors when
[testing smart contracts with Solo](test.mdx).
