# Smart Contract Initialization

Smart contracts start out with a completely blank state. Sometimes you may want to be able
to define initial state, for example if your contract is configurable. You may want to be
able to pass this configuration to the contract upon deployment, so that its state
reflects that configuration once the first request comes in. Such initialization can be
provided through an optional function named `init`.

When provided, the `init` function will automatically be called immediately after the
first time the contract has been deployed to the VM. Note that this is a one-time
initialization call, meant to be performed by the contract deployment mechanism. IOTA Smart Contracts will
prevent anyone else from calling this function ever again. So if you need to be able to
reconfigure the contract later on, you will need to provide a separate configuration
function, and guard it from being accessed by anyone else than properly authorized
entities.

To show how creating a smart contract with WasmLib works, we will slowly start fleshing
out the smart contract functions of the `dividend` example in this tutorial. Here is the
first part of the Rust code that implements it, which contains the `'`init`'` function:

<Tabs defaultValue="go"
      groupId="language"

          {label: 'Go', value: 'go'},
          {label: 'Rust', value: 'rust'},
          {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
      ]}>

// automatically disperse iota tokens which are sent to the contract to a group
// of member addresses according to predefined division factors. The intent is

// When this parameter is omitted the owner will default to the contract creator.
func funcInit(ctx wasmlib.ScFuncContext, f *InitContext) {
	// The schema tool has already created a proper InitContext for this function that
	// allows us to access call parameters and state storage in a type-safe manner.

	// First we set up a default value for the owner in case the optional
	// 'owner' parameter was omitted.
	var owner wasmlib.ScAgentID = ctx.ContractCreator()

	// Now we check if the optional 'owner' parameter is present in the params map.
	if f.Params.Owner().Exists() {
		// Yes, it was present, so now we overwrite the default owner with
		// the one specified by the 'owner' parameter.
		owner = f.Params.Owner().Value()
	}

	// Now that we have sorted out which agent will be the owner of this contract
	// we will save this value in the 'owner' variable in state storage on the host.
	// Read the documentation on schemas to understand why this state variable is
	// supported at compile-time by code generated by the schema tool.
	f.State.Owner().SetValue(owner)
}

We define an owner variable and allow it to be something other than the default value of
contract creator. It is always a good idea to be flexible enough to be able to transfer
ownership to another entity if necessary. Remember that once a smart contract has been
deployed it is no longer possible to change this. Therefore, it is good practice thinking
through situations that could require change in advance, and allow the contract
itself to handle such changes through its state by providing a proper function interface:

Note that we only define a single owner here. Proper fall-back could require multiple
owners in case the owner entity could disappear, which would allow others to take over
instead of the contract becoming immutable with regard to owner functionality. Again, we
cannot stress enough how important it is to **think through every aspect of a smart
contract before deployment**.

In the next section we will look at how a smart contract can
[transfer tokens](transfers.mdx).
