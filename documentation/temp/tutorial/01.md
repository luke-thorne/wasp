# The Solo package

_Solo_ is a Go package to write tests for IOTA smart contracts. It allows the
deployment of IOTA Smart Contracts chains and smart contracts. It also provides a toolkit for
interaction with smart contracts, for manipulation of tokens and ledger accounts
in an environment that is almost identical to the distributed multi-chain
environment of the IOTA Smart Contracts.

The Solo package and its GoDoc link [can be found here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/master/packages/solo).
The GoDocs provides a reference to all _Solo_ calls which can be used in tests
(not necessarily covered in this tutorial).

Smart contracts are notoriously isolated from the outside world. The effect of
the user interaction with a smart contract is normally only observed in its
state change. The approach in this tutorial is to explain all main concepts of
IOTA Smart Contracts development through loading smart contracts into the _Solo_ tests, invoking
its functions and examining state changes.

IOTA Smart Contracts is currently in active development, so things change and are less than
perfect. In the current stage, the IOTA Smart Contracts software is experimental. We expect
feedback from the community about hands-on experience. We also expect
contribution to the development of IOTA Smart Contracts itself, including Rust/Wasm development
environment or, possibly, alternative VM implementations.

_Solo_ is not a toy environment. It allows developers to develop and test real
smart contracts and entire inter-chain protocols before deploying them on the
distributed network.

Please follow [the link](../misc/install.md) for installation instructions.

The code of examples the tutorial can be found [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/tree/master/documentation/docs/tutorial).

## First example

The following is an example of a _Solo_ test. It deploys a new chain and invokes
a function in the `root` contract.

The `root` contract always exists on any chain. So for this example there is no
need to deploy any new contract. The test log to the testing output the main
parameters of the chain, lists names and IDs of all four core contracts.

_(Note that we include constant seed for the test so that each test run would produce exactly the seme result.
Normally we would use randomly generated value for keys)_

```go
var seed = ed25519.NewSeed([]byte("long long seed for determinism................"))

func TestTutorial1(t *testing.T) {
	env := solo.New(t, false, false, seed)
	chain := env.NewChain(nil, "ex1")

	// calls view root::GetChainInfo
	chainID, chainOwnerID, coreContracts := chain.GetInfo()
	// assert all core contracts deployed (default)
	require.EqualValues(t, len(core.AllCoreContractsByHash), len(coreContracts))

	t.Logf("chain ID: %s", chainID.String())
	t.Logf("chain owner ID: %s", chainOwnerID.String())
	for hname, rec := range coreContracts {
		t.Logf("    Core contract '%s': %s", rec.Name, iscp.NewAgentID(chainID.AsAddress(), hname))
	}
}
```

The output of the test will be something like this:

```

```
_(Note: addresses, chain IDs and other hashes will be the same on each run of the test because of the constant seed. Also, the
log produced by the test contains timestamps from computer timer, while the Solo environment operates in its own logical time)_

The core contracts listed in the log (`_default`, `accounts`, `blob`, `blocklog`
, `root`) are automatically deployed on each new chain. You can see
them listed in the test log together with their _contract IDs_.

The output fragment in the log `state transition #0 --> #1` means the state of
the chain has changed from block index 0 (the origin index of the empty state)
to block index 1. The state #0 is the empty origin state, the #1 always contains
all core smart contracts deployed on the chain as well as other variables of
chain set, such as _chainID_ and _chain owner ID_.

The _chain ID_ and _chain owner ID_ are respectively ID of the deployed
chain `$/cfQL3Vzay65ZZnPgsDKwXRRGwDWK68QkQwZqzvVs8UXM` and the address (in the
form of _agent ID_) from which the chain has been deployed:
`A/1CeHWHSLdqfJijBSM3KLqk44MTJBFGrYQ1tJGkKuWqr8q::00000000` (the prefixes `$/`
and `A/` indicate that what follows are a chain ID and an agent ID, respectively).
